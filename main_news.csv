These employees also posted internal emails to support their claim.On a ‘IT Confessions’ Facebook page, an employee from a technology company had anonymously said: “Management of our process has decided to split the staff 50% in general shift and 50% in night shift...My name is not under the list of staff who will get WFH.”The National Association of Software and Services Companies said that while employee safety was paramount, some measures must be taken to ensure that IT services companies can still service critical offerings from global healthcare, telecom networks and financial firms.“Unfortunately, most of these mission critical services cannot be processed outside of the highly secure work premises.
Hence, it is important to ensure governments enable the IT-ITes sector to function as essential services and keep those critical services operational,” Nasscom said in a statement.Cognizant CEO Brian Humphries, in an email last week, to employees said ensuring continuity for critical teams working from restricted environments, bandwidth and data security among other concerns had to be considered while enabling remote working.
The company has enabled work-fromhome for most teams since then.Experts say tech services firms face a challenge as they have not factored the dramatic shift in the need for thousands of people to work from home.“What they may not have been ready for is a scenario where your entire workforce or a large percentage of your workforce which up until now has been working from one fixed location is now going to be working from a distributed environment,” said KN Murali, director - human resources & alliances at NTT India.
